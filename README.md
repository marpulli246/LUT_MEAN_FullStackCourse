This is all the work I did during the LUT MEAN Full Stack course in spring 2021.
My first full stack app can be found at LUT_Project folder.

This app is based on the MEAN full stack video tutorial found in LUT course material.
But more features has been added to make it more customized.

Aims:  
  1.   Develop practical skills for software development
  2.   Learn the best practices and approaches of software development
  3.   Develop the skilled expected in industry to work as a software developer.

This course aims give students a chance to create unique projects with a hands-on approach. The course guides students to find their interest in software engineering skills and to help each student find their desired path in software developing in the future. There are also several other Software Development Skill courses available on different topics. The course gives the student basic understanding of full-stack development. The goal is to create a basic front- and back-end and bundle them together as a complete sys-tem.The focus is to understand the bigger picture and how to bundle different software components together to create a working program. You will learn how to use MEAN-stack as a full stack tool bundle to create an app from scratch.
